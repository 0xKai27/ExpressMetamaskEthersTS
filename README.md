# Express TypeScript Skeleton

Typescript implementation of Express using EJS. This repo has been modified from `express-generator` to enable prototyping of TypeScript applications using Express.

To run the application, user will have to run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This repository utilises nodemon upon `npm start` to automatically refresh the application when any changes have been made.
