# Express Metamask Ethers TypeScript Skeleton

Typescript implementation of connecting Metamask to Ethers.js on Express. This repo has been modified from `express-generator` to enable prototyping of TypeScript applications using Express. Moreover, it comes ready with a working Etheres.js `provider`.

To run the application, user will have to run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This repository utilises nodemon upon `npm start` to automatically refresh the application when any changes have been made.
